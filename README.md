ABSTRACT – the EOS.IO decentralized peer-to-peer blockchain is due to launch in June 2018.  While the underlying software is being written and released by block.one, it is for the community to build, own and maintain many of the crucial tools required for the EOS ecosystem to achieve its full potential and efficiency.  

Examples include the recent release of in-browser EOS wallet Scatter (N.S. James, Jan 2018), with other “EOS Essentials” in development. 
Chintai is envisaged to sit alongside other EOS Essentials as a community owned dApp solution for efficient token leasing, providing the means by which EOS token holders can lease out their tokens on one side, and for dApp creators to rent tokens for required bandwidth in return.  A number of disparate projects may be forming across the community to develop token leasing markets, and all have mentioned end user fee models as the means of funding them.


We propose a different approach that provides a highly liquid, transparent token leasing market, and which gives fair market value to all participants regardless of token size holding or token size requirements.  This will be free to use for both sides as a crucial means of ensuring full market efficiency, functioning and price discovery without transaction fee or pool distortion.
